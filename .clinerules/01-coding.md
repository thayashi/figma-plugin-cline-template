### TypeScript/JavaScript Standards
- **TypeScript First**: Write all files in TypeScript when possible
- **Strict Type Definitions**: Enable `strict: true`, avoid `any` type usage
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - File names: kebab-case (`color-inspector.ts`)
  - Variables/Functions: camelCase (`getRgbColors`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`RGB_COLOR_REGEX`)
  - Interfaces: PascalCase (`ColorData`)

### Code Quality
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code formatting and quality checks
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should have one responsibility
- **Pure Functions Preferred**: Minimize side effects
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
